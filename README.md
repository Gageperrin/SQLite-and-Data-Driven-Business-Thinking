# SQLite Data-Driven Business Thinking Project

The goal of this project is to use SQLite and Python to pull together data from separate databases, create plots to visualize the data, and derive business solutions from these results.

This project will be using the database for a fictional record company called Chinook. Using their database we will advise the company on album choices, employee performance, and sales by country among other factors.

The database schema can be found here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/191/chinook-schema.svg

This project's prompts and data were provided by the DataQuest bootcamp (https://www.dataquest.io).
